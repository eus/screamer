Building from Source

1. On the local computer install the needed base packages:

sudo aptitude install build-essential gawk binutils flex bison autoconf gettext texinfo sharutils subversion libncurses5-dev ncurses-term zlib1g-dev unzip

(I use ubuntu fiesty, if you use another distro that doesn't use apt-get or aptitude…you're on your own to figure out the command).

2.

    *
      Checkout the source for Kamikaze and the packages:

cd ~
svn co https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/ kamikaze
svn co https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages packages
ln -s packages/*/* kamikaze/package/

    *
      Optional step - Include the web interface packages (Webif²). These still have many problems so use at your own risk.

cd ~/kamikaze/package
svn co http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/xwrt/trunk/package/webif/

    *
      Bring up the configuration menu screen:

cd ~/kamikaze
make package/symlinks
make menuconfig

3. On your own for a little… choose the packages you want. Make sure you also set:

    *
      Target System > Broadcom 2.4
    *
      Target Profile > Asus wl-500g Premium
    *
      Target Images > squashfs and jffs2
    *
      Kernel modules > Proprietary BCM43xx-WiFi-driver > include the kmod-brcm-wl-mimo module
    *
      Administration > select the webif package if you choose to check it out above
    *
      Or, if you don't want to be bothered, download this attachment:config_file and copy it to:

~/kamikaze/.config

4. Make

make

Get some food, come back in 10min-1hr. Anything error out? If not continue on…if so, well, fix it.

5.

cd build_dir/mipsel
cp -rp root-brcm-2.4 /tmp/root
cd /tmp/root/etc/config/
vi network

You can of course substitute your favourite text editor for vi. The network file is new and will be empty. Make it look like this:

config switch eth0
   option vlan0    "0 1 2 3 4 5u"
config interface loopback
   option ifname   "lo"
   option proto    static
   option ipaddr   127.0.0.1
   option netmask  255.0.0.0
config interface lan
   option type     bridge
   option ifname   "eth0 wl0"
   option proto    static
   option ipaddr   192.168.1.1
   option netmask  255.255.255.0
config interface wan
   option ifname   "eth1"
   option proto    dhcp

cd ../../lib/wifi
vi broadcom.sh

There is a line way down. You need to change it to be:

channel ${channel:-5}

instead of:

${channel:+channel $channel}

6. Phewww if you're still with me and never compiled a openwrt image I salute you. Now time to make that new image and the squashfs

cd ~/kamikaze
staging_dir/host/bin/mksquashfs-lzma /tmp/root /tmp/squashfs -nopad -noappend -root-owned -le
staging_dir/host/bin/trx  -o ~/wl500w-openwrt.trx \
                -f build_dir/linux-brcm-2.4/loader.gz \
                -f build_dir/linux-brcm-2.4/vmlinux.lzma -a 1024 \
                -f /tmp/squashfs

If all is well in the world (ie you didn't make any typos) you should now have a new custom made wl500w image sitting in your home directory waiting for you.

7. Tftp the new image to the router: Unplug router, replug it back in while holding in the black reset button. Wait for a slowly blinking power light before releasing the black reset button. The remainder of the TFTP process is described here: OpenWrtViaTftp.

On first install from a stock Asus firmware or to erase all configuration settings, run:

# mtd -r erase $(cat /proc/mtd | sed -n -e 's/^\([^:]*\):.*"rootfs_data"/\1/p' )

8. Make a kamikaze, drink, enjoy.
