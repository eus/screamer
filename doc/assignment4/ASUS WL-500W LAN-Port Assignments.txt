In the website of OpenWRT, there is the picture of the relationship between the physical LAN labels at the back of ASUS WL-500g Premium router and the corresponding logical device name assigned by the Linux kernel: http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/networkinterfaces#architecture. The picture can be seen offline in asus-internals-default-sm.png. For ASUS WL-500W, however, the assignments are different.

The following is the assignments of the logical device name to the physical LAN labels for ASUS WL-500W router:
WAN   = eth1
Under eth0, there are VLAN ports:
	LAN 1 = port0
	LAN 2 = port1
	LAN 3 = port2
	LAN 4 = port3
	CPU   = port5
WLAN  = wl0

The following peculiarities have to be kept in mind:
1. The interface name for wl0 must be "lan". In other words, in /etc/config/network, it has to be:
   ...
   config interface lan
        option ifname "wl0"
   ...

2. It seems that port4 under eth0 is not associated with anything.
